This directory contains files listing third party dependencies for mercury.

To install the dependencies required for a normal mercury installation, run
pip install -r production-frozen.txt

To install the dependencies needed to run the mercury development server
(./manage.py runserver), run
pip install -r development-frozen.txt

The production.txt and development.txt files contain lists of the relevant
dependencies without known-good version information. They are used to
upgrade (e.g. pip install -U -r production.txt) and to generate the frozen
files (e.g. pip freeze -r production.txt > production-frozen.txt)
